# PrismaPulse

## Overview
This project aims to integrate WebGPU for high-performance computing on browsers and add the functionality to run lightweight AI models locally within the browser.

## Project Steps
1. Research and familiarize yourself with the latest WebGPU API specifications, focusing on its performance benefits for local computations.
2. Investigate popular lightweight AI libraries and frameworks that can be used in browser environments without requiring server-side support, such as TensorFlow.js or Brain.js.
